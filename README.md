# socks-over-https

SOCKS5 proxy over HTTP tunnel, which simply coverts a certain HTTPS proxy (which doesn't prohibit `CONNECT` on non-443 port) into SOCKS5 proxy.

## Getting Started

### Usage

```bash
socks-over-https -h

  -c string
        config file (default "config.json")
  -s string
        Send signal to a master process: install, remove, start, stop, status (default "status")
```

### Configuration

config file is defined as following json:

```
{
  "log": {},
  "settings": {},
  "proxies": []
}
```

1. log, Log configuration to control log outputs
1. settings, Server internal parameters configuration
1. proxies, socks & http proxy pairs

the proxy pair is configured as blow

```
{
    "socks":{                  // socks5 server config
        "address":"127.0.0.1", // socks5 server bind address, 127.0.0.1 by default
        "port":10800,          // mandatory, socks5 server bind port, different from each server
        "user":"",             // proxy username, no-auth by default
        "pass":""              // proxy password, no-auth by default
    },
    "https":{                   // https tunnel upstream config
        "address":"10.1.3.1",  // mandatory, upstream http proxy hostname
        "port":1080,           // mandatory, upstream http proxy port
        "user":"",             // proxy username, no-auth by default
        "pass":""              // proxy password, no-auth by default
    }
}
```

## How It Works

A typical HTTP proxy which can proxy HTTPS requests a.k.a. `HTTPS proxy` is mostly based on the [HTTP tunnel](HTTPS://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel) by using the [CONNECT](HTTPS://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/CONNECT) method of HTTP.

For example, a typical protocol of https proxy request to https://example.com/some/path is

```
CONNECT example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com:443
User-Agent: some-user-agent
Proxy-Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz
```

The proxy will open a **TCP tunnel** to `example.com:443` for the client and return

```
HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established
```

Then any traffic sent to the proxy will be redirected to the **TCP tunnel** opened by proxy.

We can turn the **TCP tunnel** above for SOCKS5 protocol's tunnel. According to [RFC1928](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1928.txt), the protocol of socks5 proxy request to https://example.com/some/path with https tunnel is

1) client sends the version identifier/method selection message to proxy

```
using socks v5, using 3 auth methods: no auth, GSSAPI and username/password
+-----+----------+----------+
| VER | NMETHODS | METHODS  |
+-----+----------+----------+
| 0x05|   0x03   | 0x000102 |
+-----+----------+----------+
```

2) server responds the version message

```
using socks v5, using the no auth method
+-----+--------+
| VER | METHOD |
+-----+--------+
| 0x05|  0x02  |
+-----+--------+
```

3) client sends the tunnel request to target server

```
CONNECT(CMD 1) to domain(ATYP 3) example.com with port 433
+-----+-----+-----+------+-------------+----------+
| VER | CMD | RSV | ATYP |  DST.ADDR   | DST.PORT |
+-----+-----+-----+------+-------------+----------+
| 0x05| 0x01| 0x00| 0x03 | example.com |   443    |
+-----+-----+-----+------+-------------+----------+
```

4) server gets the request and connects to the remote https proxy, then respond to client

- server connect to https proxy

```
CONNECT example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com:443
User-Agent: some-user-agent
Proxy-Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz
```

- remote proxy responds

```
HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established
```

- respond success (REP 0) to client

```
+-----+-----+------+------+----------+----------+
| VER | REP |  RSV | ATYP | BND.ADDR | BND.PORT |
+-----+-----+------+------+----------+----------+
| 0x05| 0x00| 0x00 |  1   | 0.0.0.0  |   7648   |
+-----+-----+------+------+----------+----------+
```

5) data transfer: Any traffic from client in written into http tunnel opened by proxy, any traffic from tunnel is written to client.
